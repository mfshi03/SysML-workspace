                For a UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) designed to operate in a snowy, dry flatland environment with a mission duration of 20 hours and 20 lifetime cycles
                Recommendation:
                - Chassis: Select a UGV with a sturdy chassis that can handle various terrains, including snow and flat lands. 
                - Power Source: Ensure that the UGV has a reliable power source 
                    that can provide sufficient energy for the vehicle's operations, including powering its sensors and motors. 
                    May include a combination of batteries or alternative energy sources, such as solar panels, to extend the vehicle's runtime
                - Sensors: Equip the UGV with a suite of sensors, including GPS, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and odometry sensors, to provide accurate navigation and localization information. 
                - Mission Planning: The mission planning system should generate optimal paths for the UGV to follow, taking into account of terrain, weather conditions, and energy constraints.
                - Data Communication: The UGV must be able to communicate with other vehicles/base stations for real-time updates.
