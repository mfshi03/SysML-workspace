### Remember
- Need at least 10 examples for fine-tuning on OpenAI

### Performance 

Our fine-tuned model works well for new samples

Example:

```
Prompt: UGV must traverse a beach terrain to complete its mission in 5 hours and 100 lifetime cycles.

Response:
Beach terrain with soft sand can sink UGVs, limiting mobility.
Recommendation:
- High flotation tracks or paddle wheels for propulsion
- Advanced sensors for precise navigation around obstacles
- Solar panels for extended endurance
- Test sand compaction rates over cycles
```
