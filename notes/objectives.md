### Project Objectives 
- Test the ability of the LLM to generate test and evaluation master plans (TEMP) based on the following scenario:

- The UGV must traverse an [rough] terrain to complete its mission within [x] hours and [y] lifetime cycles.

- Further prompt rough, x, and y

- Adjust as you see fit. Try to keep it within a LEGO robot. However, a real, full scale system is also good.

### Personal Objectives 
- Work on refining the fine-tune model with better examples to improve analysis quality
- Use analysis as input for building python unit tests
